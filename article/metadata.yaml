abstract: "We reproduce the paper \\emph{Learning with noisy labels revisited: A study using real-world human annotations}, the authors of which present novel noisy label sets for the established CIFAR datasets, based on human labelling errors. They try to prove that learning with the real-world noise present in their labels is a harder task with by conducting qualitative and quantitative experiments. We manage to confirm most of their claims, but due to weakly presented methodology fail to obtain the exact same results."
